        <p>Short history of the UNIX operating system  </p>
<p>Linux is an implementation of the UNIX operating system concept. UNIX was<br>derived from AT&amp;T’s ”Sys V” (System 5). The initialization process is meant to<br>control the starting and ending of services and/or daemons in a system, and<br>permits different start-up configurations on different execution levels (”run<br>levels”).  </p>
<p>Some Linux distribution, like SlackWare, use the BSD init system, developed at<br>the University of California, Berkeley.  </p>
<p>Sys V uses a much more complex set of command files and directives to<br>determine which services are available at different levels of execution, than<br>the BSD’s do.  </p>
<p>Booting the Linux operating system  </p>
<p>The first thing a computer does on start-up is a primer test (POST - Power On<br>Self Test). This way several devices are tested, including the processor,<br>memory, graphics card and the keyboard. Here is tested the boot medium (hard<br>disk, floppy unit, CD-ROMs). After POST, the loader from a ROM loads the boot<br>sector, which in turn loads the operating system from the active partition.  </p>
<p>The boot blocks is always at the same place: track 0, cylinder 0, head 0 of<br>the device from which we’re booting. This block contains a program called<br>loader, which in Linux’s case is LiLo (Linux Loader), or Grub (GNU Grub<br>Unified Boot Loader), which actually boots the operating system. These loaders<br>in Linux , in case of a multi-boot configuration (more operating systems on a<br>computer), permit the selection of the operating system to be booted. Lilo and<br>Grub are installed or at the MBR (Master Boot Record), or at the first sector<br>of the active partition.  </p>
<p>In the following we will refer to LiLO as boot loader. This is usually<br>installed in the boot sector, also known as MBR. If the user decides to boot<br>Linux, LiLo will try to load the kernel. Now I will present step-by-step<br>LiLo’s attempt to load the operating system.  </p>
<p>1. In case of a multi-boot config, LiLo permits the user two choose an<br>operating system from the menu. The LiLo settings are stored at<br>/etc/lilo.conf. System administrators use this file for a very detailed<br>finement of the loader. Here can be manually set what operating systems are<br>installed, as well as the method for loading any of them. If on the computer<br>there is only Linux, LiLo can be set to load directly the kernel, and skip the<br>selection menu.  </p>
<p>2. The Linux kernel is compressed, and contains a small bit, which will<br>decompress it. Immediately after the first step begins the decompression and<br>the loading of the kernel.  </p>
<p>3. If the kernel detects that your graphics card supports more complex text<br>modes, Linux allows the usage of them - this can be specified or during the<br>recompilation of the kernel, or right inside Lilo, or other program, like<br>rdev.  </p>
<p>4. The kernel verifies hardware configuration (floppy drive, hard disk,<br>network adapters, etc) and configures the drivers for the system. During this<br>operation, several informative messages are shown to the user.  </p>
<p>5. The kernel tries to mount the file system and the system files. The<br>location of system files is configurable during recompilation, or with other<br>programs - LiLo and rdev. The file system type is automatically detected. The<br>most used file systems on Linux are ext2 and ext3. If the mount fails, a so-<br>called kernel panic will occur, and the system will ”freeze”.  </p>
<p>System files are usually mounted in read-only mode, to permit a verification<br>of them during the mount. This verification isn’t indicated if the files were<br>mounted in read-write mode.  </p>
<p>6. After these steps, the kernel will start init, which will become process<br>number 1, and will start the rest of the system.  </p>
<p>The init process  </p>
<p>It’s Linux’s first process, and parent of all the other processes. This<br>process is the first running process on any Linux/UNIX system, and is started<br>directly by the kernel. It is what loads the rest of the system, and always<br>has a PID of 1.  </p>
<p>The initialization files in /etc/inittab  </p>
<p>First time the initialization process (init) examines the file /etc/inittab to<br>determine what processes have to be launched after. This file provides init<br>information on runlevels, and on what process should be launched on each<br>runlevel.  </p>
<p>After that, init looks up the first line with a sysinit (system<br>initialization) action and executes the specified command file, in this case<br>/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit. After the execution of the scripts in<br>/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit, init starts to launch the processes associated with the<br>initial runlevel.  </p>
<p>The next few lines in /etc/inittab are specific to the different execution<br>(run-) levels. Every line runs as a single script (/etc/rc.d/rc), which has a<br>number from 1 to 6 as argument to specify the runlevel.  </p>
<p>The most used action in /etc/inittab is wait, which means init executes the<br>command file for a specified runlevel, and then waits until that level is<br>terminated.  </p>
<p>The files in /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit  </p>
<p>The commands defined in /etc/inittab are executed only once, by the init<br>process, every time when the operating system boots. Usually these scripts are<br>running as a succession of commands, and usually realise the following:  </p>
<p>1. Determine whether the system takes part of a network, depending on the<br>content of /etc/sysconfig/network  </p>
<p>2. Mount /proc, the file system used in Linux to determine the state of the<br>diverse processes.  </p>
<p>3. Set the system time in fuction to the BIOS settings, as well as realises<br>other settings (setting of time zone, etc), stabilized and configured during<br>the installation of the system.  </p>
<p>4. Enables virtual memory, activating and mounting the swap partition,<br>specified in /etc/fstab (File System Table)  </p>
<p>5. Sets the host name for the network and system wide authentication, like<br>NIS (Network Information Service), NIS+ (an improved version of NIS), and so<br>on.  </p>
<p>6. Verifies the root fily system, and if no problems, mounts it.  </p>
<p>7. Verifies the other file systems specified in /etc/fstab.  </p>
<p>8. Identifies, if case of, special routines used by the operating system to<br>recognize installed hardware to configure Plug’n’Play devices, and to activate<br>other prime devices, like the sound card, for example.  </p>
<p>9. Verifies the state of special disk devices, like RAID (Redundant Array of<br>Inexpensive Disks)  </p>
<p>10. Mounts all the specified file systems in /etc/fstab.  </p>
<p>11. Executes other system-specific tasks.  </p>
<p>The /etc/rc.d/init.d directory  </p>
<p>The directory /etc/rc.d/init.d contains all the commands which start or stop<br>services which are associated with all the execution levels.  </p>
<p>All the files in /etc/rc.d/init.d have a short name which describes the<br>services to which they’re associated. For example, /etc/rc.d/init.d/amd starts<br>and stops the auto mount daemon, which mounts the NFS host and devices anytime<br>when needed.  </p>
<p>The login process  </p>
<p>After the init process executes all the commands, files and scripts, the last<br>few processes are the /sbin/mingetty ones, which shows the banner and log-in<br>message of the distribution you have installed. The system is loaded and<br>prepared so the user could log in.  </p>
<p>Linux’s execution levels  </p>
<p>The execution levels represent the mode in which the computer operates. They<br>are defined by a set of available services at any time they are started. The<br>execution levels represent different ways Linux uses to be available to you,<br>the user, or eventually the administrator.  </p>
<p>As daily user you don’t have to bother with the execution levels, although the<br>multi-user level makes the services which you need while using Linux in a<br>network (though in a transparent mode) available.  </p>
<p>In the next few sentences I’ll present the execution levels, one by one:  </p>
<p>0: Halt (stops all running processes and executes shutdown)  </p>
<p>1: Known under the name ”Single-user mode”. In this case the system runs with<br>a reduced set of services and daemons. The root file system is mounted read-<br>only. This runlevel is used when the others fail while booting.  </p>
<p>2: On this level run the most of the services, with the exception of network<br>services (httpd, named, nfs, etc). This execution level is ideal for the debug<br>of network services, keeping the file system shared.  </p>
<p>3: Complete multi-user mode, with network support enabled.  </p>
<p>4: Unused, in most of the distributions. In Slackware this level is equivalent<br>with 3, the only difference is that this has graphic login enabled.  </p>
<p>5: Complete multi-user mode, with network and graphic subsystem support<br>enabled.  </p>
<p>6: Reboot. Stops all running processes and reboots the system to the initial<br>execution level.  </p>
<p>Modification of execution levels  </p>
<p>The most used facility of init, and maybe the most confusing one, is the<br>ability to move from an execution level to an other.  </p>
<p>The system boots into a runlevel specified in /etc/inittab, or to a level<br>specified at the LiLo prompt. To change the execution level, use the command<br>init. For example, to change the execution level to 3, type  </p>
<p>init 3  </p>
<p>This stops most of the processes and takes the system into a multi-user mode<br>with networking enabled. Attention, changing the init level might force<br>several daemons used at the moment to stop!  </p>
<p>The directories of execution levels  </p>
<p>Every execution level has a directory with a symbolic links (symlinks)<br>pointing to the corresponding scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d. These directories<br>are:  </p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc0.d  </p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc1.d  </p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc2.d  </p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc3.d  </p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc4.d  </p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc5.d  </p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc6.d  </p>
<p>The name of the symlinks are semnificative. It specifies which service has to<br>be stopped, started and when. The links starting with an ”S” are programmed to<br>start in various execution levels. The links also have a number in their name<br>(01-99). Now some examples of symlinks in the directory /etc/rc.d/rc2.d:  </p>
<p>K20nfs -&gt; ../init.d/nfs  </p>
<p>K50inet -&gt; ../init.d/inet  </p>
<p>S60lpd -&gt; ../init.d/lpd  </p>
<p>S80sendmail -&gt; ../init.d/sendmail  </p>
<p>When operating systems change the execution level, init compares the list of<br>the terminated processes (links which start with ”K”) from the directory of<br>the current execution level with the list of processes which have to be<br>started (starting with ”S”), found in the destination directory.  </p>
<p>Example:  </p>
<p>When the system boots into runlevel 3, will execute all the corresponding<br>links starting with ”S”, in an order accorind to their number:  </p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S60lpd start  </p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S80sendmail start  </p>
<p>(and so on)  </p>
<p>If the system now changes to runlevel 1, will execute:  </p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/K20nfs stop  </p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/K50inet stop  </p>
<p>(presuming that nfs and inet are NOT in /etc/rc.d/rc1.d)  </p>
<p>After that it will start all the processes mentioned in /etc/rc.d/rc1.d except<br>which are already running. In this example there’s a single one only:  </p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc1.d/S00single  </p>
<p>Changing the current execution level  </p>
<p>To change the current execution level for example to level 3, edit<br>/etc/inittab in a text editor, and edit the following line:  </p>
<p>id:3:initdefault:  </p>
<p>(do not change the initial runlevel to 0 or 6!)  </p>
<p>Booting into an alternative execution level  </p>
<p>At the LiLo prompt you have to write the number of the wanted execution level,<br>before booting the operating system. This way to boot into the third level,<br>type for example:  </p>
<p>linux 3  </p>
<p>Eliminating a service from an execution level  </p>
<p>To disable a service from a runlevel, you might simply delete or modify the<br>corresponding symlink.  </p>
<p>For example, to disable pcmcia, and don’t start in the future, type:  </p>
<p>rm /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S45pcmcia  </p>
<p>Adding a service to an execution level  </p>
<p>To add a service, it is needed to create a symlink pointing to the<br>corresponding scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d. After the symlink is created, be<br>sure to assign it a number, so it would be started in the right time:  </p>
<p>To add ”lpd” to runlevel 3, type:  </p>
<p>ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/lpd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S64lpd  </p>
